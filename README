This repository contains code for demonstrating Arnold's topological
proof of the Abel-Ruffini theorem that there is no general solution in
radicals to polynomial equations of degree five or higher.

For now, it just contains some functions for working with complex
polynomials and their roots.

Tests are in tests.html.
