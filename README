This repository contains code for demonstrating Arnold's topological
proof of the Abel-Ruffini theorem that there is no general solution in
radicals to polynomial equations of degree five or higher.

quadratic.html contains a demo page for showing that an algebraic
formula (i.e. a formula relying only on addition, subtraction,
multiplication division, raising to integer powers, and the extraction
of integer roots) with no radicals cannot be the quadratic
formula.

Similarly, cubic.html contains a demo page for showing that an
algebraic formula with at most one nested radical cannot be the cubic
formula, and quartic.html contains a demo page for showing that an
algebraic formula with at most two nested radicals cannot be the
quartic formula. (Although note that the quartic formula has not just
three, but four nested radicals!)

Finally, quintic.html contains a demo page for showing that an
algebraic formula with any number of nested radicals (i.e., any
algebraic formula) cannot be the quintic formula, which is the
Abel-Ruffini theorem.

Also, this repository contains some functions for working with complex
polynomials, their roots, and continuously moving those roots.

Tests are in tests.html.
